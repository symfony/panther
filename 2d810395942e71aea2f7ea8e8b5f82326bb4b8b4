@Kocal, I added Symfony 8 compatibility in https://github.com/symfony/panther/pull/682, but that would be great to merge your PR when it is green.

I don't know exactly why @xabbuh downgraded PHPUnit.

@dunglas PR rebased, I also fixed `Client::doRequest()` types.
PHPStan is still failing there, but I'm not sure about what to do

Hi, `php-webdriver` 1.16.0 with Symfony 8 support has been released.

The PR is finally green again, with fully Symfony 8 support 🙌🏻

releasing this would allow some downstream dependencies to support Symfony 8 as well.  In particular, https://github.com/zenstruck/browser/pull/184

Any chance for a merge?

@dunglas I tested the branch with composer vcs, and it works great.
